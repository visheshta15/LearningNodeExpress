Streams are objects that let you read data from a source or write data to a destination in a continuous fashion. In Node.js, there are four types of streams :

Readable => Stream which is used for a read operation.

Writable => Stream which is used for a write operation.

Duplex => Stream which can be used for both reading and write operation.

Transform => A type of duplex stream where the output is computed based on input.


Each type of Stream is an EventEmitter instance and throws several events at a different instance of times. For example, some of the commonly used events are :

data => This event is fired when there is data is available to read.

end => This event is fired when there is no more data to read.

error => This event is fired when there is an error receiving or writing data.

finish => This event is fired when all the data has been flushed to the underlying system

Streaming means listening to music or watching a video in ‘real-time’, instead of downloading a file to your computer and watching it later
